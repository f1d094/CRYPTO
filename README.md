# CRYPTOGRAPHY PROJECT
## Realised in the context of the Master's course of Advanced Cryptography taught at the University Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC, Paris, FRANCE)


This project contains the implemetation of some cryptosystems, artithmetic objects and attacks against them. This project is fully implemented in python language.

### Currently contents implemented :
* Asymetric cryptosystems
  * RSA
  * RSA_CRT
  * ECC
* Symetric cryptosystems
  * IDEA
* Arithmetic objects
  * extended euclide's algorithm
  * Chiness Remainder Theorem (CRT)
  * Continued fraction computation
  * modular arithmetic
    * modular division
    * fast exponentiation
    * inverse
  * Large numbers
    * prime number generation
      * Rabin Miller algorithm
    * Square root for large numbers
* Attacks
  * Bellcore - RSA_CRT  (Fault Attack)
  * Broadcast - RSA 
  * Wiener    - RSA
  * Baby Step Giant Step


### TEST

For checking if the contents works correctly, run on the project's root the following command :
```bash
python3 Test.py
```
