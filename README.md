# CRYPTOGRAPHY PROJECT
## Realised in the context of the Master's course of Advanced Cryptography taught at the University Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC, Paris, FRANCE)


This project contains the implemetation of some cryptosystems and artithmetic objects and attacks against them. This project is fully implemented in python language.

### Currently contents implemented :
* Asymetric cryptosystems
  * RSA
  * RSA_CRT
  * ECC
* Symetric
  * IDEA
* Arithmetic
  * extended euclide's algorithm
  * Chiness Remainder Theorem (CRT)
  * Continued fraction computation
  * modular arithmetic
    * modular division
    * fast exponentiation
    * inverse
  * Large numbers
   * prime number generation
     * Rabin Miller algorithm
   * Square root for large numbers
  * Baby Step Giant Step
* Attacks
  * Bellcore - RSA_CRT  (Fault Attack)
  * Broadcast - RSA 
  * Wiener    - RSA


### TEST
